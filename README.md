Alumni Management System

I developed a responsive web-based Alumni Management System to strengthen the connection between alumni and the institute. The platform allows alumni to register, update their profiles, and engage with community activities. Administrators can manage alumni records, organize events, and share updates efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ Features:

Alumni can sign up, log in, and manage profiles with secure authentication.

Event Management Module to announce reunions, guest lectures, and workshops.

Database Integration (MySQL) to store alumni data, events, and communication history securely.

Interactive UI built with React.js, HTML, CSS for smooth user experience.

Backend APIs developed with Django REST Framework for reliable data handling.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: React.js | Django REST Framework | MySQL | HTML | CSS | JavaScript
